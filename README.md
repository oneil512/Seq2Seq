# TextGenerator
Attention based encoder-decoder that learns a high level representation of the style of a text corpus, and then generates similar text on its own.  I implemented it in Pytorch and followed the paper Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation (Luong et al., 2015a).
